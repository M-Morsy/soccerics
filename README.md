 For humans, development is a necessity not a luxury. The same applies for sports. Analystics on matches and players' performance on field is a hot topic nowadays.
 
 That requires great attention to each player's movements, points of strength, and weakness, and a personalized analysis for each player given match conditions and player's mental and physical state.
 
 Obviously, paying attention to all of that is proven to be overwhelming for humans to do anlone, so we are using technology aid to ease that for sports analytic men, coaches, audience, and even sports' game companies.
 
 We chose Football to apply our idea, as it's the most popular sport in Egypt, and Here comes our idea in short:
 > To use computer vision technology to monitor players performance, and overall match statistics
